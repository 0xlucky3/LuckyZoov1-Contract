## About LuckyZoo
Luckyzoo is a blockchain-based guessing game where you have to guess which animal(s) appear in one or more of the three positions to win. There are six different animals in the game.

Luckyzoo is fully operated on the blockchain and uses a chainlink oracle to provide random seeds and drawing services.Unlike other games, the prize pool in Luckyzoo cannot be withdrawn by anyone. Only the lucky winners of the game can withdraw their winnings. This ensures that the prize pool stays intact and available for future winners.

Currently, Luckyzoo is running on the Polygon network and uses $MATIC as the payment currency. Winners will also receive $MATIC as their prize. You can easily exchange $MATIC for stablecoins on a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a centralized exchange (CEX). This allows you to easily convert your winnings into a more stable currency if you wish.

## About Project
Here is the code for all of the Luckyzoo smart contracts. You can review it as it is completely open and transparent. Once the game is running smoothly, we will destroy the owner privileges.

We have only retained an interface for initial capital withdrawal, which is provided by the community initiator to provide bonus support for users who are just starting to play the game. When there are enough funds in the game, we will withdraw this initial fund and only this fund can be withdrawn. This ensures that the game has enough funds to continue operating and rewarding future winners.

If you have any further questions or need clarification on anything, please don't hesitate to ask. I'll do my best to help you.
